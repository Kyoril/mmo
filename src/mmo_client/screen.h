// This file contains the screen system. The screen system is a system which hooks into the
// event loops Paint event. It allows to draw things in order and should also simplify the 
// use of often-required graphics pipeline changes by the use of simple flags.
// For example, before each layer is drawn, the transformation matrices are set up properly
// as specified by the flags.
// To draw stuff above the screen, you can still use the Paint event in the event loop, since
// the screen system is most likely the first system to be initialized.
