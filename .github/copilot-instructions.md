For C and C++ code, ensure proper new lines and blank lines. 
Each curly brace should be on its own line.
Please ensure that methods are documented in the header file using the Doxygen format.
Each opening curly brace and each closing curly brace should be in a new line on its own.
Also don't do single line if blocks, always add curly braces around if blocks.
