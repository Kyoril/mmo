# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initial setup phase. The memory bank has just been initialized to document the project structure, architecture, and technical details. This will serve as the foundation for all future development work and documentation.

## Recent Changes

- Created the memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Documented the project brief, product context, system patterns, and technical context
- Established the documentation workflow for maintaining the memory bank

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Review the existing codebase to understand the current implementation state
2. Identify any gaps between the documented architecture and the actual implementation
3. Update the progress.md file with the current state of the project
4. Establish development priorities based on the project's current state

### Short-term Goals
1. Ensure all server components are functioning correctly
2. Verify client-server communication
3. Test basic gameplay systems
4. Document any issues or limitations found during testing

### Medium-term Goals
1. Implement missing core gameplay features
2. Enhance content creation tools
3. Improve client performance and stability
4. Expand testing coverage

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- The distributed server architecture (login, realm, world) provides a good foundation for scalability
- The use of custom binary formats for assets is appropriate for performance optimization
- The component-based design allows for flexible entity composition

### Implementation Considerations
- Cross-platform compatibility requires careful abstraction of platform-specific code
- Database performance will be critical for server scalability
- Asset loading and management will impact client performance
- Network protocol efficiency is essential for a smooth gameplay experience

### Open Questions
- What is the current state of the client implementation?
- How complete are the server components?
- What are the most critical missing features?
- Are there any performance bottlenecks in the current implementation?

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Server components are separated into distinct executables
- Shared code is organized in the src/shared directory
- Platform-specific implementations are isolated in dedicated directories

### Naming Conventions
- Class names use PascalCase
- Method and variable names use camelCase
- Constants and macros use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- File names match the primary class they contain

### Development Workflow
- Features should be developed in feature branches
- Pull requests should include appropriate tests
- Code should be reviewed before merging
- Documentation should be updated alongside code changes

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
- The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to MMORPG architecture
- The separation of concerns between server components provides good modularity
- The custom asset formats allow for optimized runtime performance

### Project Management Insights
- Documentation is critical for maintaining project continuity
- Clear architecture definitions help guide implementation decisions
- Breaking down the project into manageable components helps track progress

### Future Considerations
- Scalability will become increasingly important as the project grows
- Content creation workflows will need to be streamlined for efficiency
- Performance optimization will be an ongoing concern
