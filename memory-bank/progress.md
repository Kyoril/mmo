## Known Issues

### Server Issues
- Server stability under high load needs improvement
- Database query optimization required for better performance
- Cross-realm functionality not fully implemented

### Client Issues
- Performance optimization needed for complex scenes
- UI system needs refinement
- Asset loading can be slow for large areas

### Tool Issues
- Editor needs more features for efficient content creation
- Asset pipeline requires streamlining

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Changes
- Initial design focused on single-realm architecture, now expanded to support multiple realms
- Originally planned to use SQLite for local data, switched to MySQL for all data storage
- Added support for containerized deployment to improve scalability

### Feature Prioritization
- Initially focused on core gameplay, shifted to ensure infrastructure stability first
- Expanded scope of editor tools to improve content creation efficiency
- Prioritized cross-platform server support over client platform expansion

### Technical Decisions
- Adopted custom binary formats for assets to improve loading performance
- Implemented component-based entity system for flexibility
- Chose to use Lua for UI scripting to allow for easier customization

## Milestones

### Completed Milestones
- Basic server infrastructure
- Client login and character selection
- Initial world rendering
