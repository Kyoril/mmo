# Project Brief: MMO

## Overview
This project is an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) prototype that aims to provide all the tools required to build an MMORPG from scratch. It includes client, server, and editor components, forming a complete game development ecosystem.

## Core Objectives
- Create a fully functional MMORPG prototype with essential gameplay systems
- Develop a comprehensive set of tools for game content creation and management
- Implement a stable and scalable server architecture
- Provide a responsive and immersive client experience

## Scope
As a prototype, the project has a focused scope:
- One or two playable races
- One or two character classes
- One or two small game maps
- Core MMORPG systems (character creation, combat, quests, guilds, dungeons, parties, social features like chatting, etc.)

The scope may expand over time as development progresses, but the initial focus is on creating a complete, working prototype rather than a massive game world.

## Target Platforms
- **Windows**: Full support for all components (client, server, editor, launcher)
- **Linux**: Server components only
- **macOS**: Limited support (server components and launcher)

## Key Components
1. **Client**: The game client that players use to connect to the game world
2. **Login Server**: Handles authentication and realm selection
3. **Realm Server**: Manages character data and realm information
4. **World Server**: Simulates the game world and handles gameplay
5. **Editor**: Tools for creating and modifying game content
6. **Launcher**: Updates and launches the game client

## Development Priorities
1. Core server infrastructure
2. Basic client functionality
3. Essential gameplay systems
4. Content creation tools
5. Quality of life features

## Success Criteria
- Stable server architecture capable of handling multiple concurrent players
- Functional client with responsive gameplay
- Complete character creation and progression systems
- Basic content creation and editing capabilities
- Seamless authentication and update processes
